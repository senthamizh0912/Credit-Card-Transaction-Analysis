# Credit Card Transaction Analysis ðŸ§¾ðŸ’³

This project is based on the [YBI Foundation's Credit Card Default Notebook](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Internship/blob/main/Credit_Card_Default.ipynb), but enhanced and reworked using real transaction data.

## âœ… Enhancements Made

- âœ… Replaced broken dataset with real `CreditCardTransaction.csv` from Kaggle.
- âœ… Used `kagglehub` to download datasets directly into Google Colab.
- âœ… Performed data cleaning and conversion of transaction dates.
- âœ… Fixed column mismatches and error handling.
- âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

- Source: Government transactions dataset from Kaggle
- Rows: 788,000+ credit card transaction records
- Columns: `Year`, `Month`, `Department`, `Merchant`, `TrnxAmount`, etc.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
